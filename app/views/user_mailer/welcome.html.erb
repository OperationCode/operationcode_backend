<p>
  Welcome to Operation Code! You've just joined a community of 3000+ coders, who are all looking to further their skills and careers in software development!<br />
</p>


<p>
  We are a decentralized organization, and we work both <a href="https://community.operationcode.org/">online</a> and in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/operationcode/">local chapters</a> across the country. Please introduce yourself on our <a href="https://community.operationcode.org/c/introductions">forums</a>, and come join one of our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/operationcode/">meetups in your local area!</a> <br />
  Also, be sure to check your email for an invite to the Operation Code Slack community (<a href="https://operation-code.slack.com">https://operation-code.slack.com</a>).<br />
  Slack is where we communicate online in real-time to ask questions, collaborate, and share information. Once in Slack (you'll probably want to download the app), introduce yourself in the #general channel. An example could be: <br />
  "Hi all. My name is David. I'm from Washington and I'm interested in web development!"
  Please read our <a href="http://op.co.de/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, as well.
</p>

<p>
  The Operation Code website uses React, a JavaScript framework, and Ruby on Rails. If you want to dive in and help, you can get started by reading our <a href="https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">docs</a>, or asking around in the #oc-projects Slack channel.
  If you're interested in our mentorship program, fill out our application form as either a <a href="http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment">mentor</a> or <a href="http://op.co.de/mentor-request">mentee</a>, also!
</p>

<p>Again, welcome aboard, and don't forget to follow and share Operation Code on <a href="https://twitter.com/operation_code">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/operationcode.org">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>
  Cheers, and keep coding,<br />
  <p>the Operation Code team :)<br />
