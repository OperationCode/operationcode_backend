Operation Code allows veterans to find a mentor in the field of software development.  


- Once they have joined, users can select whether they are a mentor or a mentee.

- Mentees can request a mentoring session. Mentors respond to those requests and can create squads of their own. Squads are groups of the mentees and a mentor (or more than 1) with a common interest or goal.

Diagrams can be found at (doc/data_models):
...doc/data_models/request.png - Illustrates how a mentee user can request a mentoring session
...doc/data_models/squad.png - Illustrates the mentor/mentee relationship of a squad.
