## Operation Code Technologies

The Operation Code site is comprised of a Rails API backend, and a React frontend.

#### What is a frontend?

When you visit our website you're interacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application. The frontend application is responsible for displaying images, text and data on our web pages.

Frontend applications are usually written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilize one or more frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Vue, and React.

https://operationcode.org uses React and can be viewed at https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_frontend.

#### What is a backend?

The backend (where you are now) is responsible for:

- exchanging data with the frontend via custom API endpoints
- running various background jobs like inviting new users to Slack, or signing them up for our newsletter
- interacting with third party services like SendGrid, GitHub and ID.me
- validating the integrity of our data
- authentication and security protocols
- and more

As a contributor to the https://operationcode.org backend, you will have the opportunity to work with the following technologies, services, and popular gems:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
- [Apiary.io](https://apiary.io/)
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- [Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder)
- [ActsAsTaggableOn](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on)
- [JWT](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt)
- [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)

## Setting Up Your Environment
In order to work on the backend of the **Operation Code** site, you will need to install a few things.

### Docker
Docker is a container system. Click the appropriate link below to install Docker on your operating system.

* [Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
* [Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise edition](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
* [Windows 10 Home edition or earlier version of Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
* [Linux (Ubuntu)](https://www.docker.com/docker-ubuntu)

Note that a full installation of the Docker Toolbox includes Git as well, which is also needed to work on the backend and is mentioned below.

### Virtual Machine (AWS)
A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications.

## Create AWS VM
(Using Ubuntu 16.04 on AWS)
Make sure to open these ports in your security group
- Port 22
- Port 3000
When the VM spins up, SSH into it.

##
(from your VM)
Fork https://github.com/operationcode/operationcode_backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]/operationcode_backend.git

cd operationcode_backend

git remote add upstream https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend.git

sudo apt-get install make
```

## Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

## Install Docker Compose

```bash
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.19.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## Setting up the Dev Environment
```bash
sudo make setup
```

(if you want to try running the tests, run this command)

```bash
sudo make test
```

Now navigate to http://<vm_public_ip>:3000 and you should see the "You're running on Rails" page!

### Git
Git is a distributed version control system. This is how our code is stored and managed. Git can be frustrating, but it is an essential tool. If you want to learn more about Git, a great resource is [Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/). If you find yourself in a real git pickle, see ["Oh, shit, git!"](http://ohshitgit.com/). If you have already installed Git as a part of the Docker Toolbox, you don't need to install it again using the following link.

* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Make (for Windows only)
Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files. It is a standard part of the GNU library and is included in most distributions of Linux, as well as OSX. Unfortunately, Windows does not have a native make program, so it will need to be installed and added to PATH in order for the command line commands to work. You can use the [GNUWin general installation guide](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html) as a general guide on how to install a GNU package and add it to PATH.

* [Install Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

### Code Base
You are now ready for the actual **OperationCode Backend** code base.

* The common practice is to make a copy of the GitHub repository you want to work on (known as `forking` the repo), make your changes, and then request to merge those changes back into the project (known as a `pull request`).
* Forking a repo is done through GitHub's web UI. It can be found in the top right corner of the **OperationCode Backend**'s [GitHub](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend) page.

* The following commands will pull down the source code from your forked repo.
* Make sure to replace `[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]` with your GitHub name. (example: https://github.com/iserbit/operationcode_backend.git)

#### Local Development Environment
_Fork the repo first._
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]/operationcode_backend.git operationcode-upstream
cd operationcode-upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend.git
```

#### Database Setup:

1. Have the [Docker app](https://www.docker.com/) running
2. Run `make setup`
3. Run `make test` - recommended as it prepares your test env, and runs your tests initially.

If you run into any `bundle install` issues, run `make bundle`.

#### Running OperationCode Backend:
The OperationCode Backend has some handy shortcuts built in to make common tasks simple. You can check out the [Makefile](https://github.com/operationcode/operationcode_backend/blob/master/Makefile) to see a full listing of what these shortcuts are and what they do.

To run the OperationCode Backend simply type:
```bash
make
```

You can now visit http://localhost:3000 (or run `make open`) and you should see a Rails welcome message!

In case you used the Docker Toolbox, you might have also installed VirtualBox, which creates its own virtual network adapters. In that case, the server might be running on that IP address and may not be reachable via localhost, 127.0.0.1 or even 0.0.0.0. So, you will need to use `netstat` on the command line to figure out the IP address on which the server is bound.

## Finding An Issue
* Now you have everything setup, you will need to find issues to work on. **Operation Code** uses Github's built in issue tracker. A listing of all our issues can be found [here](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/issues).

* Familiarize yourself with the issue types below, and browse for an issue that you want to work on. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or help.

* Once you have found an issue, leave a comment stating that you plan to work on the issue. Once assigned to you, your mission is a go!

### Issue Types
Issue types are managed through labels. The below labels help us easily identify and manage issues with different workflows.

#### [Bug](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22)
Bugs are errors in code that produce unintended or unexpected results. In addition to the `bug` label, there may also be a tag indicating what the bug affects. For example [issue#124](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/issues/124) was a bug that affected the testing environment.

#### [Feature](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature%22)
Features either add new functionality or improve existing functionality.

#### [Beginner friendly](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22)
These items are hand picked as being great candidates as your first issue to work on.

#### [Roadmap](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/projects/4)
High level overview of upcoming Operation Code goals.  This is the source of upcoming issues.

## Working On Your Issue

* Please first **read** Operation Code's [guidelines for working an issue](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-working-an-issue)

* From the forked and cloned repository on your environment, you can now create a [feature branch](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). It is a good idea to name your branch after the issue it is attached to.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>
   ```

* You can check the branch your are currently working on by using the `branch` command.
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

* Once you have finished your work, head over to **Operation Code**'s main GitHub page, and make a pull request. More information about pull requests can be found in the next section.

* To return to your main `master` branch, type the following in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  ```
## API Documentation

We use [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) for our API documentation, API mocking server, etc.

The API blueprint file is located at [/operationcode_backend/apiary.apib](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/blob/master/apiary.apib), and our live API documentation itself is located at http://docs.operationcodeapi.apiary.io/

Please ensure that any PRs that change the behavior of the API are updated in the documentation as well. To do so:

- Create a free account at [apiary.io](https://apiary.io/)
- Make your additions in the repository's `apiary.apib` file in your text editor
- Cut & paste the *whole* file into [the apiary editor](https://help.apiary.io/tools/apiary-editor/) to confirm that all of these changes do not create any **semantic issues**
- Repeat until there are no semantic errors
- Commit the `apiary.apib` file as part of a normal commit in your pull request
- The API endpoints are alphabetized, so all additions will need to be placed accordingly


## Submitting Your Changes
* When you have completed work on your feature branch, you are ready to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

* Each pull request should:

  * Be tied to a single issue
  * Be named after the issue with the designated issue # as the name of the branch
  * Be fully tested
  * Have its own tests
  * Not break existing tests

* Once your pull request has been submitted, it will be reviewed by a core team member. This process helps to familiarize more people with the codebase, and provides a second set of eyes and perspective to your new feature.

* If your code is accepted, it will be merged into the `master` branch. If all the tests pass, it will be automatically deployed to [operationcode.org](operationcode.org) immediately.

* Congratulations! You have made your first contribution!

### Bots

Each pull request is inspected by the following bots:

* [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com) - Checks for style validation errors, insecure and problematic code on pull requests.

* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) - Runs the test suite on each check in, and deploys each change that gets merged.
